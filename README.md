# Simple SQLite3 Source integration for Unreal Engine 4

Based on [SQLite3UE4 Plugin by Jussi Saarivirta & KhArtNJava](https://github.com/KhArtNJava/SQLite3UE4/) but with compiling SQLite3 as part of the module code, this opens up compiling it (hopefully) on all platforms without any extra process.

# Difference to SQLite3UE4

SQLite3UE4 integrates sqlite3 as a ThirdParty module, which leads to a chain of complexity and also requires people to build the sqlite3 library before using it. On CISQLite3, we integrated the sqlite3 code directly into the module, and so it gets linked like the rest of the module on compile.

# Compiled and Tested on

Windows x64 | 4.21.0 | âœ“

# Installation

Copy this plugin (like Download as ZIP) into the folder **Plugins/CISQLite3** on your project and a start of the project should compile the plugin automatically, if the project is C++. If you don't have a C++ project, then you can just make one for the sole purpose of compiling this plugin. Alternative you can install it as Engine Plugin in the Engine Plugins directory (like **Epic Games/4.12/Engine/Plugins/Runtime/CISQLite3**).

```c++
    PublicIncludePaths.AddRange(
      new string[] {
        "CISQLite3/Public"
      }
    );

    PrivateIncludePaths.AddRange(
      new string[] {
        "CISQLite3/Private"
      }
    );
```

For use direct in project change to:

```c++
    PublicIncludePaths.AddRange(
      new string[] {
      }
    );

    PrivateIncludePaths.AddRange(
      new string[] {
      }
    );
```

To avoid compile error for "SQLiteDatabase.h" not found, add the plugin to your {Project}.Build.cs as follows:

```c++
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class Craftaverse : ModuleRules
{
	public Craftaverse(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
	{
		PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;

		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "HeadMountedDisplay" , "CISQLite3" });
	}
}
```

## C++

And here's a simple sample in C++:

Header:
```c++
UCLASS()
class SQLITE_API AMyActor : public AActor
{

  GENERATED_BODY()

public:

  UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "My Actor")
  bool GetMyStats();

  UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "My Actor")
  FString Name;

  UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "My Actor")
  int32 Age;

  UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "My Actor")
  FString Gender;

  UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "My Actor")
  float Height;

};

```

CPP:

```c++
#include "MyActor.h"
#include "SQLiteDatabase.h"

bool AMyActor::GetMyStats()
{

  FString dbName = TEXT("TestDatabase");
  FString actorName = TEXT("Bruce Willis");

  if (!USQLiteDatabase::IsDatabaseRegistered(dbName))
  {
    USQLiteDatabase::RegisterDatabase(dbName, "Databases/TestDatabase.db", true);
  }

  bool didPopulate = USQLiteDatabase::GetDataIntoObject(dbName, FString::Printf(TEXT("SELECT Name, Age, Gender, Height FROM Actors WHERE Name = \"%s\""), *actorName), this);

  return didPopulate;

}
```
